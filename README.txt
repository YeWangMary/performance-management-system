This is application used for staff performance management. This application can keep track of employeeâ€™s working hours, and leave days and provide a real time feedback environment. This is a microservise architecture based application. For the frontend, I used Angular8 to build a single-page application, So that users can easily login to their account and access their profiles. I built several components with Algular8 such as authentication and profiles, and used services to transfer data among components.
